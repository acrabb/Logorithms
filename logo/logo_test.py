"""Unit testing framework for the Logo interpreter.

Usage: python3 logo_test.py FILE

Interprets FILE as Logo source code, and compares each line of printed output to
an expected output described in a comment.  For example,

print 2+3
; expect 5

Differences between printed and expected outputs are printed with line numbers.
